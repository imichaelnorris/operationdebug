# Operation Debug
Simple debug server.

Make web requests from your app.

The requests will show up on the Operation Debug server.

Configure your dashboard however you want.

# v0.0.1
This is a very broad undertaking.

v0.0.1 will have a pretty simple requirement:
receive requests and store them in an HTML table that's sortable by timestamp.

Each request received will be stored in the table as JSON.
